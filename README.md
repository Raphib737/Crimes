# Crimes

Welcome to our CS105 Final Project! 
Authors : Molly Shopper, Amalia Safer, Raphael Baysa 

Here we analyze crime during the time of days and what kind of crimes are committed by using what we learned from CS105 from databases, to machine learning,  to data visualization. 

More will be added in later as this project progresses.
